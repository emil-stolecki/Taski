<h1>Taski</h1>

<p>Taski is a task manager application for a programing portfolio.</p>

<p>It allows the user to create different types of task and add it to a calendar. The two types of task the app currently enables are Simple Task and Event. </p>

<p>Simple Task is a one-time task. The user can schedule it for a specific day, set just a deadline and add it to the calendar later, or just save it without any time limitation and add it to the schedule when it's convinient.</P>

<p>Event can be a recurring task. The awailable repeating patterns are: daily, on specified days of week, specified days of month (eg. on the 1st, 5th and 18th day of each month), each x of days.</p>

<p>The user can choose a day in the week or month view to jump to.</p>

<p>The user can see all tasks, edit their titles and descriptions directly in the table or edit the rest after being redirected to this task in a day view.</p>

<p>The user can also acces task's edit mode by clicking it on the time line or picking it from the panel on the right.</p>

<p>When tasks overlap eachother or then the user inputs invalid data, a warning will be displayed.</p>
